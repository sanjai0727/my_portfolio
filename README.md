# Sanjai's Portfolio Website

Welcome to my personal portfolio website! This project is a modern, interactive showcase of my academic journey, technical skills, and projects in the fields of Data Science, Artificial Intelligence, and Software Engineering.

## 🌌 Project Overview

This portfolio is designed to be more than just a resume; it's an immersive digital experience. Built with **React** and **Vite**, it features a futuristic "Space/Nebula" theme that reflects my passion for exploring the unknown frontiers of technology. The site leverages advanced animations and glassmorphism to create a premium, depth-rich user interface.

## 🎨 Visual Identity & Design

The design philosophy centers around a dark, atmospheric aesthetic:

*   **Theme**: Deep space background (`#0b0b0b`) populated with dynamic, parallax starfields and floating nebula orbs.
*   **Liquid Glass Effect**: Containers utilize a translucent, blurred "frosted glass" effect with subtle gradients (Orange to Pink to Purple), providing modern depth and hierarchy.
*   **Interactive Elements**:
    *   **Cursor Particles**: A trail of colorful particles follows the user's mouse movement.
    *   **Parallax Stars**: Background elements shift slightly based on cursor position, creating a 3D feel.
    *   **Animations**: Smooth entry transitions using `Framer Motion` and typewriter effects for dynamic text presentation.

## 🚀 Key Sections

1.  **Hero Section**:
    *   A bold introduction featuring a typing animation loop highlighting my roles: "AI & ML Enthusiast", "Problem Solver", "Software Engineer".
    *   Quick access to download my Resume or view my Projects.

2.  **About**:
    *   A personal introduction sharing my background and passion for technology.

3.  **Skills**:
    *   A visual grid of my technical proficiency, featuring icons for **Python**, **JavaScript/TypeScript**, **React**, **TensorFlow**, **Docker**, and more.

4.  **Projects**:
    *   A detailed showcase of my best work, including:
        *   **Real-Time Emotion Detection System**: Webcam-based emotion analysis using MTCNN and Mini-XCEPTION.
        *   **AI-Powered Webcam Image Captioning**: Offline image description generation using the Salesforce BLIP model.
        *   **Human-Mode Auto Typer**: A tool mimicking human typing patterns for automation.
        *   **Pocket AI**: A privacy-first, offline AI assistant powered by Phi-3 Mini.

5.  **Education**:
    *   A timeline of my academic path, from High School to my current B.Tech in CSE (Data Science & AI) at Dr. M.G.R. Educational and Research Institute.

6.  **Contact**:
    *   A fully functional contact form integrated with **EmailJS** for direct messaging.
    *   Direct links to my **GitHub** and **LinkedIn** profiles.
